## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>

    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the app**:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### [`npm start`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22npm%20start%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CVS%20CODE%5C%5CReact%5C%5CReact%5C%5CPintrest%20Frontend%5C%5Cpackage.json%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fc%253A%2FVS%2520CODE%2FReact%2FReact%2FPintrest%2520Frontend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FVS%20CODE%2FReact%2FReact%2FPintrest%20Frontend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### [`npm test`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22npm%20test%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CVS%20CODE%5C%5CReact%5C%5CReact%5C%5CPintrest%20Frontend%5C%5Cpackage.json%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fc%253A%2FVS%2520CODE%2FReact%2FReact%2FPintrest%2520Frontend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FVS%20CODE%2FReact%2FReact%2FPintrest%20Frontend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")

### [`npm run build`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22npm%20run%20build%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CVS%20CODE%5C%5CReact%5C%5CReact%5C%5CPintrest%20Frontend%5C%5Cpackage.json%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fc%253A%2FVS%2520CODE%2FReact%2FReact%2FPintrest%2520Frontend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FVS%20CODE%2FReact%2FReact%2FPintrest%20Frontend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A17%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")

Builds the app for production to the [`build`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22build%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CVS%20CODE%5C%5CReact%5C%5CReact%5C%5CPintrest%20Frontend%5C%5Cpackage.json%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fc%253A%2FVS%2520CODE%2FReact%2FReact%2FPintrest%2520Frontend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FVS%20CODE%2FReact%2FReact%2FPintrest%20Frontend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A17%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

### [`npm run eject`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22npm%20run%20eject%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CVS%20CODE%5C%5CReact%5C%5CReact%5C%5CPintrest%20Frontend%5C%5Cpackage.json%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fc%253A%2FVS%2520CODE%2FReact%2FReact%2FPintrest%2520Frontend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FVS%20CODE%2FReact%2FReact%2FPintrest%20Frontend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A19%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you [`eject`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22eject%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CVS%20CODE%5C%5CReact%5C%5CReact%5C%5CPintrest%20Frontend%5C%5Cpackage.json%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fc%253A%2FVS%2520CODE%2FReact%2FReact%2FPintrest%2520Frontend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FVS%20CODE%2FReact%2FReact%2FPintrest%20Frontend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A19%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition"), you can't go back!** This command will remove the single build dependency from your project, copying all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project so you have full control over them. All the commands except [`eject`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22eject%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CVS%20CODE%5C%5CReact%5C%5CReact%5C%5CPintrest%20Frontend%5C%5Cpackage.json%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fc%253A%2FVS%2520CODE%2FReact%2FReact%2FPintrest%2520Frontend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FVS%20CODE%2FReact%2FReact%2FPintrest%20Frontend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A19%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.
